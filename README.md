# CDC Environmental Justice Index Data

In January 2025, the CDC removed its Environmental Justice Index (EJI) page from its website pursuant to Trump Administration Policy.

The last archive.org archive of the EJI home page is available [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20241105220532/https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/eji/index.html). 
An archive of the CDC's EJI page download is also [available](https://web.archive.org/web/20250131192221/https://eji.cdc.gov/eji_data_download.html) (and is still available at eji.cdc.gov as of this writing).

The data available as of January 31, 2025 are archived here in the formats (GDB and CSV) provided by the CDC from the page above.
